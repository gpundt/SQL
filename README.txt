This repo contains scrips and assignments from class. Scripts create databases and execute basic SQL commands.

Within these folders, there are .txt files, and there are .sql files.

.sql files are the scritps that create a database, modify a database, or execute a sequence of queries.
.txt files are TEE files, documenting the functionality of the corresponding .sql script.
